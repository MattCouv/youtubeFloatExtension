# YoutubeFloatExtension
This is still a work in **progress**.


Current version 0.1


This script creates a  ui on top of the actual ui of youtube
to improve user experience and allows users to watch videos without leaving the page and switch between videos quickly.


It is not meant to be a replacement of the current ui it is an imrpovement.

#How to ?
simple copy the script to the console while on youtube and voila.


On every modification you need to reload the page and paste again the script.
#Todo :
- add closed popup button
- add overlay controles when minimized(maximize, stop)
- add the hability to cue videos
